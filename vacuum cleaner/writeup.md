<h1><b>Vacuum Cleaner Ai<b></h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<h3>Given M x N grid(floor) create an agent that moves around the grid until the entire grid is clean<h3>
    <ul><li>Move the agent anyway you see fit until the floor is clean, Zig-Zag in my implementation</li>
        <li>Agent starts at first floor first column</li>
    </ul>


<h2>Logic</h2>
<h3><p><ul>   
    <li>Create your clean function</li>
    <li>Create a print function that shows current position of the vaccum cleaner at every move your agent makes</li>
    <li>Floor is represented in this manner,
        # '1' represents dirty and '0' represents clean
        floor = [ [1, 0, 0, 0], 
                  [0, 1, 0, 1],
                  [1, 0, 1, 1]]</li>
    <li>To clean simply convert '1' to '0'</li>
</p></h3>
